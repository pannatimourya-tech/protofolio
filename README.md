    <b>Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Competitive Programming</b>. I enjoy transforming complex
    problems into efficient solutions, whether it's through <b>DSA</b>, <b>Python/Java/C</b>, or building modern web projects.

    Currently, I’m focusing on improving my <b>problem-solving skills</b>, contributing to open-source, and developing
    projects that blend creativity with real-world applications. Beyond coding, I love exploring UI design and mentoring
